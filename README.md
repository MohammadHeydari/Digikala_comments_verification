# Description

Digikala (https://www.digikala.com/) has recently published some open source data in various categories.

Since I always wanted to do some NLP project, so I thought of some useful tutorials in python for newcomers.
I really hope this could be useful for you guys.

I still keep updating the package and also will share the link of video and article related to this post soon!

### Before you run models

First you should run the 0 - data Wrangling.ipynb to preprocess the data before starting for the rest of files.

## Requirements

Use these conda commands to install the packages in environment:

conda create -n < environment_name > python==3.7
conda install -f -y -q -n < environment_name > -c conda-forge requirements.txt

## Dataset

I got mini-version of digikala customers comment dataset from www.quera.ir 
which was uploaded for a AI competetion on 1398/08/16.
This is the link (Needs authentication).
