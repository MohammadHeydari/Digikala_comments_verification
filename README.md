# Description

[Digikala](https://www.digikala.com/) online market has recently published some open source data in various categories.

Since I always wanted to do some NLP project, then I thought of some useful tutorials in python for newcomers.
I really hope this could be useful for you guys.

I still keep updating the package and also will share the link of video and article related to this post soon!

### Before you run models

First you should run the 0 - data Wrangling.ipynb to preprocess the data before going for the rest of files and creating your models.

## Requirements

Use these conda commands to install the packages in environment:

`conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt`

## Dataset
